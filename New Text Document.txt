Notes for 6/27.

1. Contact Jennifer Frick about questionnaire. jmfrick@wal-mart.com
2. Do research on hiring practices and create a list of actionable items.
That means sites that are cheap, looking into existing options, and determining price.
3. Look into tabling at other locations.
4. Really, we should be looking at all options for attracting employees.

One thing that could be done is an employee referral program. Paying 50 dollars for each new employee.

So lets say we have 135% turnover within the store. Thats like 600 hires. 
about 5 new people per week

5*52=260

6000 for indeed.com
6000/260. Only 23 dollars per employee. 

Need tonya for new employees. 

once we have the list of employees we can figure it out. 

We could also interview the new hires about it. 
4 people per ASM is reasonable, but perhaps more.

Hello Gary,

As the ASM interns we have developed a pilot program for helping new associates get to know the management of this store. This program will run for the next 4 weeks, and the dates are as follows:

Week 1: Monday 7/2 -> Sunday 7/8
Week 2: Monday 7/9 -> Sunday 7/15
Week 3: Monday 7/16 -> Sunday 7/22
Week 4: Monday 7/23 -> Sunday 7/29

Note: Week 1 will not include the most recent hires, who are not yet scheduled and need to complete GLMS.

Each week every ASM will be asked to meet with a handful of associates throughout the store for individual 15-minute meetings. Below is a list of associates you are being asked to meet with. During this meeting we are asking that you complete a short form, which can be found in the ASM office at the back of the store. If you feel like you cannot meet with all of your new hires please let us know, we can accommodate a change in assignments with no questions asked. Please be aware that this should not take the place of a break or lunch, but should be completed separately.
